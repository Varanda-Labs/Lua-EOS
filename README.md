# Lua-eos
Lua EOS is a embedded multi-task framework where the application layer can be written in Lua Scripts.
It provides event driven non-preemptive Lua tasks.
It is the same successful idea been used in many systems where Java VM provides a secure way for end users to
write applications without compromising the native implementation. Lua is very light weight and suitable for
embedded systems.
