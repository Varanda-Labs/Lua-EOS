# Lua-EOS
Lua EOS is an embedded multi-task framework where the application layer can be written in Lua Scripts.
It provides event driven non-preemptive Lua tasks.
It is the same successful idea been used in many systems where Java VM provides a secure way for end users to
write applications without compromising the native implementation. Lua is very light weight and suitable for
embedded systems.  
The solution that Lua EOS delivers: product suppliers can securely provide programming capabilities to their end users without disclosing any native code (libraries). End user scripts run "out-of-the-box" from the file system. For example, supposed a company sells a weather station; The end user could write small scripts to take actions like turn fan on when temperature is above a value, send an email when a sensor is triggered, etc.
