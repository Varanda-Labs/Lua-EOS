styles:

  removed:
    lv.style_init (replaced by lv.style_create).
    lv.style_copy (also replaced by lv.style_create)
    lv.style_list_get_style (does not make sense... lua can have a table for that)

  added:
    lv.style_create(original) if original is nil created. Otherwise, create a copy of original.
